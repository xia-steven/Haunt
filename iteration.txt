Players had difficulty understanding our pedestal mechanic and its influence on player health. We decided to 
overhaul the tutorial (again) to create a dedicated tutorial wave so the player sees the game's mechanics in their natural context.

Other criticism was on the lack of theme and flavor, so we injected some story dialogue to ground the experience and added 
more sprites to communicate the medeival graveyard setting.

We also had numerous gameplay bugs last week that we found in playtesting and fixed, like the restart game not working.
