The main piece of feedback we received was that we lacked a lot of player guidance and visuals.  To improve this, we added a new 
tutorial level, explaining all of the basic mechanics of the game.  In addition, we added player movement, dodge visuals, pedestal
indicator arrows, pedestal health bars, and better pedestal visuals.

Some other feedback included the constant clicking to shoot (now can hold left mouse to fire), large amount of pedestal enemies 
(rebalanced enemy waves to include a small minority of pedestal enemies), and player shooting pedestals to "repair them" (player now
destroys pedestals and enemies fix pedestals).

Also, we fixed numerous bugs found in playtesting, including enemies pathing through walls, dash continuing after the time expires, 
and enemies freezing next to pedestals.
